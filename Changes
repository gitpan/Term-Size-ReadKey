Revision history for Perl distribution Term-Size-ReadKey.

0.03  Thu Feb 28 2008
        - reconciliated dist with 5.005 (thanks, Slaven Rezic)
        - we still cheat in tests

0.02  Wed Feb 27 2008
        - borrowed the rewritten basic test from Term-Size-Perl
          (Jul 1 2007)
        - applied an ugly cheat to test just like Term::ReadKey
          actually does (set COLUMNS and LINES environment variables)

0.01  Mon May 29 2006
        - first release to CPAN
